In the rugged wooded hills of the Empire, two daring thieves, Kael and Lyra, embarked on a perilous mission to infiltrate the formidable castle of Hardaggen, home to The Naru.

Under the cloak of darkness, they ventured into a tunnel with ankle-deep flowing water. As they delved deeper, a faint glimmer of blue caught their eye. Intrigued, they moved closer to investigate, triggering the trap. A blinding blue flash engulfed them, turning the water into solid ice, trapping them in its grip.

"Quick, we must get out of here!" Lyra urged, panic rising in her voice.

Frantically, they chipped away at the ice with their daggers, and after a tense struggle, they managed to break free. With haste, they dashed through the tunnel, hearing the approaching guards' voices behind them. Spotting a hidden crevice in the wall, they squeezed through, finding themselves in a narrow passage leading away from Hardaggen.

Silently, they navigated through the dense woods, hearts pounding in their chests. Finally, they emerged outside the fortress, concealed within the shadows. Grateful for their escape, they vowed to be more cautious in their future endeavors, knowing that their lives were more valuable than any treasure they sought.

# Ice Shackles
Ice Shackles are an ancient magical trap, when triggered, the trap activates a powerful freezing effect, turning any nearby water into solid ice and blinding intruders with a brilliant blue flash of light.

## Mechanics

### Activation
The trap is activated when a creature steps on the hidden magic rune submerged beneath the water. This rune is invisible to the naked eye, and only a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to detect its presence.

### Saving Throw
Upon triggering the trap, all creatures within a 20-foot radius centered on the rune must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's feet become encased in solid ice, rendering them restrained and unable to move.

### Ice Formation
After the initial activation, the water in the tunnel quickly turns into solid ice within a 50-foot radius centered on the rune. This icy terrain becomes difficult terrain for any creature trying to move through it. A successful DC 15 Strength check allows a restrained creature to break free from the ice, ending the restraint effect.

### Blinding Flash
The brilliant blue flash of light upon activation temporarily blinds all creatures within a 15-foot radius centered on the rune. Those affected suffer the blinded condition until the end of their next turn.

### Duration
The ice remains in place for 1 minute after activation, gradually melting away afterward. The blinding effect lasts for one round.

## Countermeasures

### Disarming the Rune
A character proficient in the Arcana skill can attempt to disarm the trap by making a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, they temporarily deactivate the rune, preventing it from triggering for 1 hour.

### Detection and Avoidance
Careful inspection of the tunnel floor might reveal subtle clues or a faint magical aura, allowing characters to detect the rune before triggering it. Upon detection, characters can avoid stepping on it, bypassing the trap altogether.
