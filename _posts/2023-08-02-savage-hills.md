The rugged lands south of the Dead Godsâ€™ Sea are home to the Free Dreamers, primitive Vosche tribes that rejected modernity. They see themselves as the rightful heirs Vosche antiquity, and followers of Sleeping Prophets. Orxis war bands often set camp here, raiding north in search of plunder and glory. The tribes of the Savage Hills are often victims of raids by Marian slavers who capture slaves to toil in the plantations of the Grand Marian Bay.
