Tundrum Wasps are flightless wasps native to rocky, mountainous regions of Oda. They are known for their strong and resilient exoskeletons, powerful legs, and loud humming noise that serves as a warning to potential predators and a means of communication with other Tundrum Wasps. These aggressive creatures can burrow into the ground for shelter and protection.

Tundrum Wasps are social insects that live in colonies led by a powerful queen. The queen is the largest individual in the colony and is responsible for laying all of the eggs that will develop into worker wasps and potential future queens.

Tundrum colonies can range in size from a few dozen individuals to several hundred, depending on the availability of resources in their environment. The wasps are highly territorial and fiercely defend their nests from any perceived threats, often using their powerful mandibles to attack intruders.

The queen of a Tundrum colony is an essential figure, as she is responsible for maintaining the reproductive health of the colony. She produces chemical signals that keep the other wasps in the colony in line and stimulates the development of worker wasps, which are responsible for foraging and caring for the young.

The queen is typically guarded by a retinue of worker wasps, who protect her from harm and ensure her well-being. When a colony becomes too large, the queen will produce new queens that will fly off to start their own colonies, leading to the expansion of the Tundrum's reach across the land.

Domesticated Tundrum Wasps are used as mounts by mountain warlords, underworld figures and adventurers who need to travel quickly through rough terrain. The Tundrum Wasp saddle is specially designed to fit the wasp's body, and riders use a series of commands to direct its movements. Though the Tundrum Wasp can be trained and tamed by skilled handlers, they are known for their unpredictable nature and can be dangerous if provoked.

In combat, Tundrum Wasps use their sharp mandibles to attack enemies and defend themselves. They can also use their powerful legs to strike or knock down foes, and their loud humming noise can be used to intimidate opponents. Though they are not able to fly, their mobility and toughness make them formidable opponents.
