A vast strait separating the east and west of the Riftlands, the Rift was created when an object from space struck Oda a millennia ago. The debris from that impact can be found across Oda, but is very rare. Only in the waters of the Rift can you find significant quantities of the mineral known as Urdstone. Urdstone has unusual magical properties, and has become highly valued. Urdstone can be refined into a metal known simply as Urd that is prized by for its appearance and high strength-to-weight ratio. The Rift is home to many fishing villages, but many Rift fisherman moonlight as pirates.
