#### Magic Armor (Heavy), *Unique Artifact*

The Armor of Kas Tona is a rare and powerful magical armor produced by Gnallix technicians before the Godswar. The armor was originally created for industrial, not combat, applications.

While wearing the armor, the character has an Armor Class of 18 (no Dexterity bonus), and gains a +2 bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores.

The wearer must attune to the armor by wearing it for one hour. Once attuned, you can wear it without penalty, even if you are not proficient with heavy armor.

This armor has a number of charges, which can be used to power its various abilities. The armor has a maximum of 10 charges, and regains 1d8+2 charges at dawn each day.

## Armor Abilities
The armor has the following abilities, which can be used by spending a number of charges as noted:

Laser Blast (1 charge)
: The character can use a powerful laser blast from the armor's chest plate, dealing 2d6 radiant damage to a single target within 60 feet.

Force Field (2 charges)
: The character can activate a force field around themselves, granting them temporary hit points equal to their level + their Constitution modifier.

Rocket Boost (1 charge)
: The character can use the armor's built-in rocket boosters to launch themselves forward, giving them an additional movement speed of 30 feet and allowing them to fly over obstacles or difficult terrain. Can be used as a reaction for an additional charge.
