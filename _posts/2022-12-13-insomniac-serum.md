When a target ingests Insomniac Serum, they will be unable to get a good night's rest.

Even though they are able to regain hit points, spell slots, and other features restored by rest, they will still gain one level of exhaustion each day. A successful medicine check will reveal a slight purple hue in the target's eyes, indicating that they have been poisoned.
