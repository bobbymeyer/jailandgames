The Black Dread Temple, veiled near the Ragged Edge of Xiyan, stands as a secretive tribute to [Nikantankya]({% post_url 2021-06-13-nikantankya %}), the god of darkness, the night, eclipses, and the afterlife. Crafted from imposing blocks of black stone, the temple's somber exterior is adorned with intricate carvings depicting mysterious faceless men and ancient inscriptions, their meanings faded with time.

Upon entering, an air of enigma fills the space. Towering black pillars, etched with cryptic imagery and inscrutable words, punctuate the interior. At the heart of the temple rests a monumental statue of Nikantankya, hewn from the same obsidian-like stone, its eyes gleaming like distant stars.

The guardians of the temple are the Nightslaves, devoted monks who have sacrificed their very lives to safeguard its secrets. In exchange for dark insights into the afterlife, they have committed themselves to eternal servitude. These dedicated individuals maintain the temple's rituals and upkeep, preserving its mystique. The temple hosts ceremonies shrouded in candlelight and accompanied by haunting songs that pay homage to the night and its arcane wonders.

Beneath the temple, an endless labyrinth of tunnels winds its way through the earth, a mysterious underworld where the boundaries of reality and the realm of Nikantankya converge. These labyrinthine passages are said to hold untold mysteries and secrets, accessible only to those deemed worthy by the Nightslaves. It is whispered that those who venture into the depths may uncover forgotten knowledge, or perhaps even come face-to-face with the enigmatic deity himself.
