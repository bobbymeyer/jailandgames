summary: "Mud & Mystery"
---

This region is mostly wetland, filled with swamps, bogs, and mangrove forests. It rains nearly everyday, and dry land is rare and highly contested by the Otun clans. The only cities are in the black river delta, and even these are small, rugged settlements. A major industry of the Mires is mudlarking for pieces of Urdstone. Otun Clans have a strict code of hospitality, and while outsiders are discouraged, those that are accepted and brought in must be protected and provided for. Due to this, Otun is a common destination for pirates and bandits that have allowed themselves to become too notorious and can afford the hospitality of the clans. No guest has ever been successfully extradited from the Mires.
