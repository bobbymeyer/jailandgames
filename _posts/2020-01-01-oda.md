summary: "the Terrible World"
---
> Oda. A world in flux. A world where the past is lost, and the future is uncertain. Immense cities rise from the shores, while the dark forests and jungles of the interior remain unexplored. Behemoth creatures emerge from seas and caves, while ghosts lurk in the shadows collecting secrets.
> Oda. A terrible world.

# the Twin Planets

There are nine planets in the twin planet system; five orbiting Oda and four orbiting Omorro. The moons are home to the dreaded Moon Devos, whom are believed to be demonic in the lore of most Odaic people.

{: .full-image }
the Banana Kingdoms
: Before the Gods' War, the north shores of the Riftlands were home to a race of early humans. These men stood seven feet tall, and were master stoneworkers. Their masonry is a mystery to modern men, but the most learned scholars of the Riftlands believe they had access to a potion that softened stone, and allowed them to mold it to any shape. They built immense cities dominated by high-angled pyramidal temples. They domesticated the purple banana, a powerful hallucinogen. They created plantations dedicated to the production of the fruit which was used in secret religious rituals. This race did not survive the Gods' War, their knowledge was lost, and the jungle swallowed up their cities. The ruins are now ruled by the [Hmonqi](/hmonqi), intelligent monkeys raised to sentience by the powers of the purple banana.

The temperatures on these alpine plains are too cold for agriculture, but is well suited to raising and grazing Red Aurochs. The herders who maintain the Auroch are skilled horsemen, and are legendary marksmen. The coastal cliffs are studded with small, but densely populated cities carved into the cliff face. They subsist on fish caught by net and pulled up the cliff face by large cranes.

The region is populated by the only known Riftland Vosche population that predates the Gods’ War. These Vosche are culturally dissimilar to their Tradeland cousins. They reject dreams, and undergo extensive training to minimize the amount of sleep they need. To them, sleep invites nightmares, and to dream summons demons into the waking world.

They have no contact with the outside world, and no desire for it. The Oqi-San Vosche are a warlike people, and are constantly at war with each other. Outsiders are attacked on sight.

The only cities are in the black river delta, and even these are small, rugged settlements. A major industry of the Mires is mudlarking for pieces of Urdstone. Otun Clans have a strict code of hospitality, and while outsiders are discouraged, those that are accepted and brought in must be protected and provided for. Due to this, Otun is a common destination for pirates and bandits that have allowed themselves to become too notorious and can afford the hospitality of the clans. No guest has ever been successfully extradited from the Mires.

Urdstone has unusual magical properties, and has become highly valued. Urdstone can be refined into a metal known simply as Urd that is prized by for its appearance and high strength-to-weight ratio.

People living on these islands are often very isolated, even from each other, due to the treacherous nature of seas surrounding them. Most of the islands are inhabited by either he Sun-O, a race of [Human](/human) pygmies, or the Sun-Yi, a small population of [Durrha](/durrha) that have developed in isolation from their arctic brothers.

The men of this region are valued across Oda as fierce mercenaries, but are infamous for their lack of discipline and the sackings and massacres that occur in any theater they operate in. Sonios has enormous jade statues of robed figures dotting the landscape. The origin of these statues is lost, but they are obviously very ancient. Due to the prevalence of these statues, and the relatively flat terrain, at least one of these statues can be seen from nearly any point on the expanse, and they have come to serve as guideposts and gathering spaces for the Sonios Cro-Mags.

The largest cities are [Cro-Mag](/cro-mag) settlements founded around volcanic calderas. These settlements are dominated b y a priestly caste of Lavamancers, who use telekinetic magics to conduct and form magma into walls, towers and temples. These communities are defensively oriented, as the Salt Wastes mark the westernmost vanguard of [Orxis](/orxis) expansion. This leading edge of the Orxis horde represents the most violent and aggressive bands outside of the Blood Peaks.

{: .full-image }


Urdic Kays
: The Urdic Kays have the highest concentration of Urdstone anywhere on Oda. Many companies have created fortified mines to extract and refine the material into Urd. The landscape was once green and fertile, but aggressive strip mining has rendered it a brown-black morass of mud and stone. People who remain in the kays for signifiacnt period of time come down with a illness that causes fatigue and fever within months, and those that do not leave the islands eventually develop sores and tumors. Many of the richest factions on Oda have a stake in the Urdic Kays, but none of the stakeholders personally attend to them.

The Blood Peaks
: The Blood Peaks are a tall, jagged range of mountains that splits the Tradelands down the center. It has also been called the World Spine. The Blood Peaks earned their current name during the Gods’ War, when the Herule killed Oraxis, spilling his blood and intestines across the peaks. As Oraxis bled, his blood formed rivers that filled the valleys between the mountains. Few animals live in the the Blood Peaks, as most have been hunted to extinction by the [Orxis](/orxis). Few non-Orxis humanoids live in the Blood Peaks, and those that do are hardy and dangerous. The Blood Peaks are home to many ancient ruins, dating back to the time of the Gods’ War. It is rumored that powerful artifacts can still be found in these ruins, if one knows where to look.

the Burning Plain
: The Burning Plain is an expanse of wild Fire Rye that stretches from the Dead Gods' Sea to Blood Peaks. Fire Rye is a valuable and nutritious grain, but the hull of the seed is incredibly flammable. A stiff wind can create enough friction between the stalks to ignite the plants, causing huge regional prarie fires. Fire Rye seeds require exposure to extreme heat to germinate, and the soils of the Burning Plain are fertilized by the ash from these fires. No permanent settlement exist on the plain, and only nomadic tribes of Tulgg and Orxis dare to live there permanently.
