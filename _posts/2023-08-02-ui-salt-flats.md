A flat and desolate land, where day time temperatures are oppressive. Most of the fauna of this region, including the humanoids, have adapted to a nocturnal lifestyle. The largest cities are [Cro-Mag](/cro-mag) settlements founded around volcanic calderas. These settlements are dominated by a priestly caste of Lavamancers, who use telekinetic magics to conduct and form magma into walls, towers and temples. These communities are defensively oriented, as the Salt Wastes mark the westernmost vanguard of [Orxis](/orxis) expansion. This leading edge of the Orxis horde represents the most violent and aggressive bands outside of the Blood Peaks.
