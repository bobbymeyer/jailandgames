In the dimly lit corridors of the ancient castle, Cedril moved with a stealth that belied his desperation. His heart raced with the exhilaration of impending freedom, each step a quiet testament to his cunning and resolve. The musty air of the dungeon had given way to the fresher breezes that whispered through the castle's inner passages, carrying with them the sweet scent of the forest just beyond the walls. Cedril's mind was alight with images of the woods, the freedom, and a life reclaimed from the clutches of his unjust captivity. His fingers grazed the rough stone walls, feeling for the telltale signs of the hidden exit he had learned about from a fellow prisoner, a forgotten route once used by secret lovers and clandestine plotters.

As he neared the threshold of freedom, his foot, guided by fate or misfortune, landed upon a hidden pressure plate with an ominous click. In an instant, the hopeful rhythm of his heart was shattered by the sound of heavy iron cuffs springing from their concealment, clamping down mercilessly around his ankles. The weight was immediate and overwhelming, dragging his dreams down into the cold, hard reality of his imprisonment. Desperation turned to despair as the echo of approaching guards filled the corridor, their torchlight casting long, dancing shadows that played upon the walls like specters of his failed escape. Cedril's fleeting taste of freedom was cruelly snatched away, leaving him bound and waiting in the darkness for the inevitable grasp of his captors.

Trigger
: This trap is triggered when a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate.

Effect
: As soon as the trap is triggered, a pair of heavy iron boots spring out from a concealed compartment in the ground and clamp around the creature's ankles.

Immediate Effect
: The creature's movement speed is reduced to 5 feet per turn due to the weight and restrictive nature of the boots.
Strength Check to Mitigate: The creature can attempt a Strength check (DC 15) at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the boots loosen slightly, allowing the creature to move at half its normal speed instead of being restricted to 5 feet.

Escaping the Boots
: The boots can also be unlocked with a successful Dexterity check using thieves' tools (DC 15). Alternatively, they can be broken with a successful Strength check (DC 20).

Detection
: A creature can notice the pressure plate with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 14).

Disabling the Trap
: A character can attempt to disable the trap with a successful Dexterity check using thieves' tools (DC 15). Failing this check by 5 or more triggers the trap.
