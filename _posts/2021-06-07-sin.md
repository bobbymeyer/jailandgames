Sin is often depicted holding its floating severed head, with smoke and light emanating from the wound at the neck. The head itself is encompassed by an iridescent silver halo. Sin is favored by Warlocks, to whom he is generous in assistance. He is connected to sleep, dreams, omens, silver, journeys and change. Dragonflies are sacred to Sin.
