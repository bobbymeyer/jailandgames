# **Cult Practice: The Order of Boemon's Soil**
This Cult Practice may be selected by a [Priest]({% post_url 2023-09-11-priest %}) at level one. These Priests dedicate themselves to worship of [Boemon]({% post_url 2021-06-02-boemon %})

## **Boemon's Call**
At 1st level, Priests who select this Cult Practice can feel the heartbeat of the land. As an action, they can touch the ground to gain tremorsense within a 30-foot radius for 1 minute, allowing them to detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within this range, effectively "seeing" without relying on sight. Once used, this ability can't be invoked again until after a short or long rest.

## **Boemic Spade**
Upon selecting this Cult Practice at 1st level, the Priest receives a Boemic Spade. This holy symbol can be used as a focus for their spells and also serves as a martial weapon with the same statistics as a spear. When wielded, the spade provides advantage on Religion checks related to earth, soil, or the god Boemon.

## **Father's Protection**
At 3rd level, as a reaction, the Priest can invoke the protective spirit of Boemon to grant themselves or an ally within 10 feet resistance to damage from the next attack that hits them. Once used, this ability can't be used again until after a short or long rest.

## **Blessing of the Golden Sequoia**
Starting at 6th level, once per long rest, the Priest can invoke the power of the Golden Sequoia to heal. By touching a creature, they can restore hit points equal to their Priest level x 5.

## **Radiant Aid of the Holy Knight**
At 10th level, the Priest can bless a martial weapon with the radiant power of Boemon, adding an extra 1d8 radiant damage to its attacks. This blessing lasts for 1 minute. Once used, this ability can't be invoked again until after a long rest.

## **Strength of the Earth's Core**
Starting at 14th level, the Priest, channeling Boemon's strength, gains the ability to cause minor tremors in the earth. As an action, they can make the ground shake in a 20-foot radius, causing enemies to make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. This power can be used once per long rest.

## **Boemon's Avatar**
At 17th level, once per long rest, the Priest can invoke Boemon's essence, transforming into a powerful earthly avatar. In this form, they gain resistance to all damage, their strength score increases by +4, and they can command the earth to rise or fall within a 30-foot radius. This transformation lasts for 1 minute.

## **Apotheosis: Earth's Ultimate Guardian**
At 20th level, the Priest embodies the very essence of Boemon. Once per long rest, they can summon a coal black stag with iron antlers to serve as a mount for 1 hour. While riding the stag, they are immune to damage from non-magical sources, can move through solid earth and rock as if it were air, and their Boemic Spade attacks deal an additional 2d8 radiant damage.

## **Sacred Duties**
Priests of Boemon are expected to maintain and protect places of natural growth, especially those of the Golden Sequoia. They conduct rituals during the planting and harvest seasons, and they mediate disputes, maintaining the order as Boemon desires. Reading from the "Alchemy of Soil" is a daily duty, and many take pilgrimages to the Iron Dome, the head temple, to gain deeper insights into their god's will.
