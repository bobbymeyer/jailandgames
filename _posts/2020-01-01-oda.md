summary: "the Terrible World"
---

> Oda. A world in flux. A world where the past is lost, and the future is uncertain. Immense cities rise from the shores, while the dark forests and jungles of the interior remain unexplored. Behemoth creatures emerge from seas and caves, while ghosts lurk in the shadows collecting secrets.
> Oda. A terrible world.

# the Twin Planets
Oda, with its' twin Omorro, is one of two K-Type worlds trapped in a physio-temporal binary orbit. Most on Oda believe Omorro to be the home of the Gods. There are nine planets in the twin planet system; five orbiting Oda and four orbiting Omorro. The moons are home to the dreaded Moon Devos, whom are believed to be demonic in the lore of most Odaic people.

# Adventure and Power
Oda is a world of great opportunity. A world where anything is possible. A world where the brave and the bold can make their mark on the world. Oda is a world of great danger, but it is also of great opportunity. Those who are brave enough to confront the dangers of Oda can find great wealth and power.
