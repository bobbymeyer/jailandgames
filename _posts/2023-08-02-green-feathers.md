Green Feathers is a stepped series of high elevation plains flanked by a sheer cliff coast. The temperatures on these alpine plains are too cold for agriculture, but is well suited to raising and grazing Red Aurochs. The herders who maintain the Auroch are skilled horsemen, and are legendary marksmen. The coastal cliffs are studded with small, but densely populated cities carved into the cliff face. They subsist on fish caught by net and pulled up the cliff face by large cranes. The cliff people have a religion based on humanoid sacrifice, and often engage in piratical raids to gather new victims.
