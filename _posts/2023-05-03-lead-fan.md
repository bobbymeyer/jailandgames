Price

The Lead Fan is a unique weapon that features multiple barrels that fan outward, allowing it to attack everything in a 15-foot cone. These pistols are rare, and are produced only in small quantities for elite customers. They are made of exotic materials, ornately carved and etched. They are designed for ease of use, making it an ideal weapon for aristocrats who need to fight off multiple attackers with minimal training. The Lead Fan deals 1D10 damage upon a successful hit. No attack roll is made when using the Lead Fan. Instead, all creatures within the weapon's 15-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking damage. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the full damage of 1D10. If they succeed, they take no damage. Users on the Lead Fan must be wary of friendly fire, as allies within the area of attack are also vulnerable.

Reloading the Lead Fan is a time-consuming process and can only be done during a short or long rest.
