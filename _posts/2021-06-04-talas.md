Talas is shrouded in black robes that cover everything but her eyes. Gem-topped golden pins adorn and seal the robe. She is the goddess of paths, stars, prophecy, luck, wind, light and the moons. Talas is known to guide lost rangers back on course. Fire, pythons and bats are sacred to Talas. Talas wields a bow that can fire arrows at Odaic targets.
