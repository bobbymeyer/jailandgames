The northern-most of the Four Cardinal Seas, the Crashing Sound is also the lest populated. Most settlements are small, due to the rocky soil and cold climate. The waters are rougher than in the other members of the Four Cardinal Seas. The sound is more politically fragmented than the other Cardinal Sea regions, as the sheer cliffs and narrow valleys of the region dotted with a plethora of small but sturdy fortresses, controlled by a warrior nobility and garrisoned by their legendary Courtsword entourages.
