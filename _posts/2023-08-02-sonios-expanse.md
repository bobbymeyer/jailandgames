Sonios Expanse is a large steppe, covered in rolling hills, rocky streams, and tall purple and teal grasses. Nomadic Cro-Mags dominate the region, riding large striped tapirs. The men of this region are valued across Oda as fierce mercenaries, but are infamous for their lack of discipline and the sackings and massacres that occur in any theater they operate in. Sonios has enormous jade statues of robed figures dotting the landscape. The origin of these statues is lost, but they are obviously very ancient. Due to the prevalence of these statues, and the relatively flat terrain, at least one of these statues can be seen from nearly any point on the expanse, and they have come to serve as guideposts and gathering spaces for the Sonios Cro-Mags.
