The Burning Plain is an expanse of wild Fire Rye that stretches from the Dead Gods' Sea to Blood Peaks. Fire Rye is a valuable and nutritious grain, but the hull of the seed is incredibly flammable. A stiff wind can create enough friction between the stalks to ignite the plants, causing huge regional prarie fires. Fire Rye seeds require exposure to extreme heat to germinate, and the soils of the Burning Plain are fertilized by the ash from these fires. No permanent settlement exist on the plain, and only nomadic tribes of Tulgg and Orxis dare to live there permanently.
