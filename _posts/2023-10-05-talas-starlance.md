# Talas' Starlance
*Melee weapon (Legendary spear), requires attunement*

Crafted from the otherworldly Urdstone, this spear once graced the hands of an Avatar of Talas during the Godswar. Legends speak of its incredible power, thrown across the vast Rift to vanquish one of Oraxis' formidable warlords. It shimmers with a unique, celestial radiance, and the spearhead seems to contain a living pulse of radioactive energy.

## Abilities

**Foretold Throw**: Before releasing a ranged attack with Talas' Starlance, the wielder can tap into the future for a fleeting moment. As a bonus action, after announcing the use of this feature but before making the attack roll, roll a d20. If the result would miss the intended target, the spear isnâ€™t thrown, however, an action is still consumed.

**Riftspan Throw**: Once per long rest, the wielder can launch the spear with supernatural might. It becomes a ranged weapon attack with a range of 120 feet. If it connects, it inflicts an extra 6d10 radiant damage and forces the recipient to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. Magically, the spear returns to the wielder's grip after the throw.

**Urdstone Radiance**: Talas' Starlance is always enveloped in a mesmerizing glow, illuminating a 40-foot radius with bright light and casting dim light for another 40 feet.

**Legacy of the Godswar**: The wielder can pronounce the spear's command word to gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against Orxis for 1 minute. This power is rejuvenated after a long rest.
