The Red River is the longest on Oda, due to its slow meandering path across the flat, red-orange grasslands. The river is home to many species of fish, including the giant river eel, which can grow up to 20 feet long. The Red River is also the only place on Oda where the rare and valuable red pearls are found. Small manorial holdings line the coasts. These manors are owned by the River Lords, an unusual feudal order in which each lord owes allegiance to the Lords downstream from him. The River King rules in Danupel, a large walled city on an island in the estuary where the Red River meets the Dead Godsâ€™ Sea. Danupel cannot be reached at high tide, except by a narrow causeway, and due to this has never been successfully sieged.
