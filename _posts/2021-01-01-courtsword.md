A Courtsword is a kind of warrior common throughout Oda, but closely associated with northern Tradelands. The Courtsword trains himself to fight without any conscious thought or effort. They fight purely on their well-honed instincts. The monastic quality of their training produces excellent warriors and instills the values of loyalty, bravery and obedience. Because of these traits, Courtswords are valued as bodyguards to many powerful and influential figures.

# Abilities

No Mind
: In battle, you fight on pure instinct and can react without effort. On your turn, you can enter No Mind as a bonus action.
: While in No Mind, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
: You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
: When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a Courtsword, as shown in the No Mind Damage column of the Courtsword table.
: You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
: If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while in No Mind.
: Your state of No Mind lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your No Mind on your turn as a bonus action.
: Once you have entered No Mind the number of times shown for your Courtsword level in the No Mind column of the level advancement table, you must finish a long rest before you can enter No Mind again.

Unarmored Defense
: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

Danger Sense
: At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.
: You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

Instinctual Attack
: Starting at 2nd level, when you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack without conscious effort. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

Sword School
: At 3rd level, you choose a Sword School that shapes the nature of your No Mind. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

Ability Score Improvement
: When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
: Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

Extra Attack
: Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Fast Movement
: Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

Pure Instinct
: By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.
: Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

Effortless Power
: Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
: This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

Insensate
: Starting at 11th level, your No Mind can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while in No Mind and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
: Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

Persistent No Mind
: Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

Subconscious Power
: Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

Combat Enlightenment
: At 20th level, you embody the power of the subconscious. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

# Sword Schools

## Cobra School
The Cobra School practices a form of No Mind that focuses on repeating hypnotic mantras intended to obliterate self-doubt and concern for physical safety.

### Abilities

Serpent Mantra
: Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can repeat a mantra that temporarily reduces feelings of fatigue. If you do so, for the duration of your No Mind you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your No Mind ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

Fearless Mantra
: Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while in No Mind. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter No Mind, the effect is suspended for the duration.

Fear Mantra
: Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.
: If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

Revenge Mantra
: Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
