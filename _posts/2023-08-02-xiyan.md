The great desert of Xiyan is a vast, dry wasteland, dotted with rich Oases. The desert is home to few creatures, and those that do live there are hardy and adapted to the harsh conditions. Travel through the desert is difficult, and few people attempt it without help from nomadic trade caravans that supply the Oasis towns.
