Phuel is a transparent and odorless liquid, serving as the primary fuel for Phortrexes and other Gnallix inventions. When Phuel comes in contact with air, it spontaneously combusts, generating a flame that's entirely invisible to the naked eye. Despite lacking any illumination, the flame still gives off scorching heat and can ignite flammable materials.

Due to its combustibility, extreme caution must be taken when handling Phuel. Once exposed to air, the resulting flame is invisible, yet exceedingly hot and capable of causing significant damage to anything that crosses its path.

A small amount of Phuel contained in a vial can cover an area of 5 feet square and burn for approximately one minute before dissipating harmlessly.

Any creature who enters or begins their turn in the affected area of Phuel must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) to avoid taking 2d6 fire damage. A successful save results in half damage.

Despite the fiery effects of Phuel, creatures who observe its use rarely perceive the nature of the invisible flames or the danger it poses. Perceiving a Phuel fire requires a Perception check (DC 15, Gnallix roll at Advantage).
